## Acknowledgements

This project was initially generated with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) using the [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin) template. The layout and tooling has been heavily modified since then, but it was very helpful to start.
